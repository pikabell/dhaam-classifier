# dhaam-classifier

This is a Github project that uses the FastAI library to classify images into one of the four Dhams of India. The project utilizes a ResNet18 neural network architecture to achieve high accuracy in classifying the images.

## Dhams of India

Dhams are sacred places in India that are believed to be the abodes of the Hindu deities. There are four main Dhams in India: Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath. These places are visited by millions of devotees every year, and being able to identify them automatically can be useful in various applications.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of the four Dhams, collected from scraping images from duck duck go. The images have been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure that they are of high quality and consistent size.

## Training

The ResNet18 architecture was chosen due to its proven effectiveness in image classification tasks. The model was trained using the FastAI library, which provides a high-level API for training deep learning models. The training was done on a GPU to accelerate the process and achieve better performance.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of over 95% on the test set, which demonstrates its effectiveness in classifying the images of the four Dhams.

## Future Possibilities

There are several possibilities for future development of this project. One possibility is to expand the dataset to include more images of the Dhams or other similar sacred places. Another possibility is to fine-tune the model to recognize specific features of the Dhams, such as their unique architecture or surroundings. The model could also be integrated into a mobile app or website to provide information about the Dhams to visitors.

## Differences from Standard Cat and Dog Classifier

While the task of classifying cats and dogs is a popular example of image classification, this project is different in that it focuses on classifying images of sacred places. The Dhams have unique characteristics and features that are different from cats and dogs, making it a more specialized and challenging task. Additionally, the use of the ResNet18 architecture allows for better performance and accuracy than standard models.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of using deep learning and the FastAI library for image classification tasks. The model achieves high accuracy in classifying images of the four Dhams of India, and there are several possibilities for future development and application.
